# Rates Simulation
In this repository there is code (in Python code and Jupyter Notebooks) that
can be used for simulating the future behavior of interest rates, in a monthly
basis, and some visualization tools to display in a visual manner this 
simulated future behaviour.

The main tools to simulate this future behaviour are Geometric Brownian Motion
Monte Carlo simulations, VAR Monte Carlo simulations and Poisson Monte Carlo
simulations. 

THIS IS STILL IN CONSTRUCTION AND IS IN THE VERY BEGINNING STAGE.
