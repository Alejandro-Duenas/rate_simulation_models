# Rates Simulation
In this repository there is code (in Python code and Jupyter Notebooks) that
can be used for simulating the future behavior of interest rates, in a monthly
basis, and some visualization tools to display in a visual manner this 
simulated future behavior.

The main tools to simulate this future behavior are Geometric Brownian Motion
Monte Carlo simulations, VAR Monte Carlo simulations and Poisson Monte Carlo
simulations.
