# Rates Simulation
In this repository there is code (in Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks) that
can be used for simulating the future behavior of interest rates, in a monthly
basis, and some visualization tools to display the simulated behavior and the
historical variations and other key insights. 

The main tools to simulate this future behavior are Geometric Brownian Motion
Monte Carlo simulations, VAR Monte Carlo simulations and Poisson Monte Carlo
simulations. With this tools, then we can see the maximum values in the 
simulations, the 5th and 95th percentiles and the median of the simulation.

## *Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) Simulation*
In the GBM model, I use the logarithmic transformation of the returns of the
input series (this means that we'll work with the instantaneous returns).
